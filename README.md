This is a base project to be forked and used in later work.

It supports

- containerization
- secret injection
- configuration
- logging
- testing
- linting

This project will be for scripts that run, and exit
But I should extend this script for microservice HTTP/grpc/graphql type services

## Linting
`black` is used for code formatting, `flake8` is used for PEP enforcement, `mypy` is for type checking.
